			<h1>Latest Product</h1>
			<p><img src="images/ruckus-wireless-network.png" width="160px" height="106px" alt="ruckus" />Ruckus technologies offer unmatched simplicity, ridiculous reliability, and killer coverage at a fraction of the cost of alternatives. Industrial-strength Smart Wireless LAN products for enterprise systems eliminate cost and complexity, while delivering unprecedented performance and reliability.</p>
			<h4>The Components of Ruckus Networks</h4>
			<p>Indoor, outdoor, meshed, video, voice, data, 802.11n, 802.11a, 802.11g-take your pick. Everything you need is uniformly managed as a single, centralized Wireless LAN with ZoneDirector. Or you can manage thousands of standalone APs or ZoneFlex wireless LANs remotely with FlexMaster. Ruckus Smart WiFi products support even the most rigid, latency-sensitive applications-offering carrier-level quality and ironclad security to enterprises and service providers everywhere.</p>
			<ul class="content">
				<li><strong>Central Management</strong> - The Ruckus ZoneDirector provides secure centralised control</li>
				<li><strong>Triple Play Ready</strong> - Smart antennas and QoS support voice, video and data traffic</li>
				<li><strong>Simple To Use</strong> - easy wizard and menu driven interfaces for ease of use</li>
				<li><strong>Industry Standard Security</strong> - Up to WPA2/AES with integration to Active Directory and Radius</li>
				<li><strong>Mesh Enabled</strong> - support for mesh where Ethernet is not available</li>
				<li><strong>Real Time Management</strong> - the ZoneDirector automatically manages RF channel and power</li>
				<li><strong>Multiple SSIDs</strong> - including advanced features such as controlled Guest access</li>
				<li><strong>Dynamic PSK</strong> - Per user key removes the major limitation of this type of security</li>
				<li><strong>Limited Lifetime Warranty</strong> - warranty on all internal equipment</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Reliable WiFi</h4>
			<p>People are sick and tired of unstable connections dropped packets and erratic performance. The Ruckus wireless LAN (WLAN) delivers better coverage capacity and reliability. People want the sophistication of a high-end WLAN but is more affordable and easier to deploy and manage.</p>
			<h4>Easy to Setup and Manage</h4>
			<p>Fully pluggable, meshable, and easy to install, configure and expand with automatic client administration and advanced security as well as a Quality of Service (QoS) which supports triple play data, video and voice.</p>
			<h4>Beamflex - Using Smart Antenna Technology</h4>
			<p>For greater speed, fewer errors, and instant bandwidth delivery, BeamFlex offers first-of-its-kind smart antenna technology that maximizes signal coverage, throughput, and network capacity. It delivers MIMO benefits to 802.11a/b/g/n devices, to further increase MIMO diversity gain and maximize spatial multiplexing potential—at minimal cost.</p>
			<p>BeamFlex consists of a smart, compact antenna array with multiple elements, which can be combined in real time to form unique antenna patterns. The advanced BeamFlex software continually learns the environment with all its hostilities and interference sources, including disruptive RF conditions, numerous communicating devices, network performance issues, and application flows. Then, it selects the optimum antenna pattern for each communicating device in real time, while actively avoiding interference and minimizing noise to nearby networks and devices.</p>
			<h4>Smart Quality of Service (QoS)</h4>
			<p>Smart QoS, and application-aware traffic classification capabilities deliver robust wireless transport for Multi-media streams.</p>
			<p>When SmartCast detects a wireless client subscribing to a multicast streaming application, such as IPTV or a VOIP call, it directs the associated multicast packets to each subscriber, using the optimum data rate and signal path. To ensure peak performance, all packets are queued/de-queued by specialized schedulers, optimized for the corresponding traffic type, the delay/jitter tolerance and bandwidth requirements of the traffic, and the changing characteristics of each station on the WLAN.</p>
			<h4>Smart Security is Vital in Wireless LANs</h4>
			<p>
				SmartSec is a unique collection of security capabilities that automates client-side security, making it easy to use. It provides a patent-pending mechanism that generates, configures, and installs encryption keys on client devices—in a process that's totally transparent to the user.
				<br/>Featuers:
				<ul class="content">
					<li>Pre-shared encryption keys</li>
					<li>Role-based user access</li>
					<li>Layer 2/3 client isolation</li>
					<li>Robust link layer encryption </li>
					<li>Wireless intrusion detection</li>
					<li>Industry first Dynamic PSK</li>
					<li>Captive portal authentication</li>
					<li>Automatic guest access</li>
					<li>ActiveDirectory, LDAP, and RADIUS support</li>
				</ul>

			<h4>Intelligent Indoor and Outdoor Mesh</h4>
			<p>With Ruckus SmartMesh Networking, you reduce cumbersome RF planning and costly cable backhaul, as Ethernet wiring is no longer needed to connect to individual access points. Enterprise WLAN deployment becomes dramatically faster, simpler, and less costly, as access points are simply plugged into any convenient power source. No extensive RF site surveys, cable runs, configuration, or optimization adjustments are required.</p>
			<p>SmartMesh Networking is the first WiFi meshing approach that combines high-gain smart antenna arrays, sophisticated RF routing, and centralized management in a single WLAN system. And it extends Smart WiFi technology to create a new class of reliable WLANs that are self-organizing, self-optimizing, and self-healing.</p>
			<h4>Ruckus is the home of 802.11n - Why?</h4>
			<p>To successfully apply 802.11n to high bandwidth enterprise applications such as video conferencing, medical image sharing, interactive learning, and IPTV, there's really only one place to turn: Ruckus Wireless technology.</p>
			<p>Why Ruckus? Because 802.11n uses "spatial multiplexing" to combine two beams of data at the receiving end, theoretically doubling throughput-but also doubling the chances of interference Ruckus BeamFlex Smart antenna technology mitigates interference by sending WiFi energy only in the intended direction, thereby greatly increasing the range of successful spatial multiplexing. In addition, Ruckus improves 802.11n's "channel bonding" techniques which combine two 20Mhz channels into a single 40MHz channel for increased throughput. With BeamFlex, channel bonding effectivenes is increased four-fold.</p>
